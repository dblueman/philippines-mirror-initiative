# Philippines Mirror Initiative

## Overview

With limited connection quality outside major cities, accessibility of and downloading free software (eg Ubuntu, Fedora and Debian) is limited and slow. This restricts the adoption and use of Open Source in Education in the Philippines.

This project seeks to deploy, maintain, quantify and document a network of inexpensive RaspberryPi 5s, each with a large SSD to act as a geographically-redundant mirror.

## What can be mirrored?

Any content with no commercial funding aligned to the manadate of learning and development, for example:
- DepEd Open Education Resources: https://www.deped.gov.ph/alternative-learning-system/resources/oer/
